<b>Real Time Case Example:</b>Whaling Attack Leads To Firing Of FACC Boss
In 2016, Austrian Aerospace company FACC had been subject to one of the most prominent Whaling attacks ever, dubbed the Fake President Incident, where the attacker made away with $56 million.

In a classic whaling attack, the perpetrator impersonated the CEO and sending an email to an employee of the finance department requested an immediate funds transfer.

The attack didn't only cost the firm financial losses, but it also cost the CEO at the time, Walter Stephan, his position. Although the details were not revealed, the sack was on the grounds of violation of duties
